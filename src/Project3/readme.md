# Reading and writing from console

## Reading
1. [Console.ReadLine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.readline(v=vs.110).aspx)
1. [Console.WriteLine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.writeline(v=vs.110).aspx)
1. [Console.Write](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.write(v=vs.110).aspx)

## Question
* What's the difference between Write and WriteLine?
* What's the return value type of the ReadLine.

## exercise
* Open Project 3 and find the Program.cs file.
* Find the PrintPositiveIntegers method.
    * Call this method in the Main function.
* Run the program and describe what the function does.
* Modify the program so that it will keep asking to enter a positive interger until the user enter the text "exit".
