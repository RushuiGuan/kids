# Exercise 1
Create a program to calculate and display the area of a rectangle.

1. The program should ask the user to enter the length and width of the triangle.
    * Check the user input and make sure that they are valid.
1. The program will then calcuate and display the result on the screen.
1. The program should ask the user if he or she want to perform another calculation.  The user should be able to enter Yes, Y, No or N.
    * If the user enters N or No, the program should exit.
    * If the user enters Y or Yes, the program should restart from step 1.

# Exercise 2
Same as the exercise 1 but calculate the area of a triangle instead.

# Exercise 3
Same as the exercise 1 but calculate the area of a circle instead.


# Exercise 4
1. Combine the first three exercises by first asking users what kind of shape are we calculating the area for?  Proceed to ask for the required parameters for the area calculation and output the result to the screen.
1. Repeat step 1 until the users enter the text exit when asking for the type of shape.
